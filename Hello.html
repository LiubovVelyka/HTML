            <p>
                I am a motivated person with strong attention to detail. I am looking for a company where I could learn and grow as a Manual QA Engineer.
I have a good understanding of QA processes, requirements, methodology, types/approaches of testing. I have experience in testing Web applications, Database, APIs. I create test documentation (test cases, test plans).
Thanks to my experience, I am a thoughtful and meticulous person, good at "diagnostic", looking for and finding problems, organized, and experienced in multi-tasking.
